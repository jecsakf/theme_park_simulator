# Theme park simulator

This project was prepared by 3 of us in a university course. The aim of the project was to solve a complex problem over a whole semester, following an agile methodology. The game was created as a WPF project in C# with MVVM architecture. I was responsible for creating the viewmodel and contributed to the model.
